Hi, I’m Roushan Gupta, a technical content developer. Today, I'd like to share an approach called the Docs as Code approach. Don’t worry if this sounds unfamiliar — I’ll explain it in simple terms. We’ll go over what it means, how it works, and why it’s becoming such a popular way to create and manage documentation. And if you’ve already heard of it, you might discover a few new benefits you didn’t know about.

## What is the Docs as Code Approach?

The Docs as Code approach is a way of writing, managing, and publishing documentation using the same tools and workflows that software developers use for writing code.

Think of it this way—instead of using a traditional word processor or a separate content management system, we treat our documentation files just like source code. This means technical writers and developers can work together seamlessly, integrating new features and pushing updates to the documentation in a fast, collaborative process.

## Why use software development tools for documentation?

This approach relies on a few key tools that make the entire process consistent, collaborative, and automated. Here's a quick breakdown of the most common ones and why they're so important.

- **Visual Studio Code:** This is a popular and powerful text editor. One of its biggest advantages is that it allows you to write in plain-text formats like Markdown. It also has excellent built-in support for many other tools you might use alongside it.
- **Git:** This is a version control system. It's the backbone of the entire approach. Git allows you to track every single change made to the documentation, see who made it, and easily revert to an older version if needed.
- **GitHub:** GitHub is a platform that hosts Git repositories. It's where the documentation lives and where the collaboration happens. You use it for pull requests, which allow team members to review and approve changes before they are published.
- **GitHub Actions:** This is a robust automation tool. Once a change is approved and merged, a GitHub Action can automatically trigger a process to build the documentation and publish it to the live website. This is the "continuous integration" part of the process.
- **Docusaurus:** This is a static site generator. It takes all of your plain-text documentation files (written in Markdown) and turns them into a professional, easy-to-navigate website. Docusaurus is just one example; others include Jekyll and Hugo.

## The Benefits of Docs as Code

Using this approach offers several major advantages:

- **Collaboration:** It breaks down the barrier between writers and developers, allowing everyone to contribute to the documentation using familiar tools.
- **Consistency:** The use of version control and a single source for all documentation ensures that all content is accurate and up to date.
- **Automation:** Automated publishing pipelines save time and eliminate manual errors, making it possible to publish new updates almost instantly.
- **Version Control:** You can easily manage different versions of your documentation, ensuring that users see the correct information for the software they're using.
